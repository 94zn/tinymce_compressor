Version 2.0.3 (2010-02-20)
    Added to the main tinymce_compressor github repo
    Moved the docs in README into POD in tiny_mce_gzip.pl itself

Version 2.0.2 (2008-12-23)
    Tested with TinyMCE version 3.2.1.1
    Updated the tiny_mce_gzip.js from the PHP compressor version 2.0.2

Version 2.0.0 (2008-03-28)
    Tested with TinyMCE version 3.0.5

    Updated the tiny_mce_gzip.js from the PHP compressor version 2.0.1
    Added support for the 'suffix' and 'core' parameters
    custom_files were not being included - fixed
    Added the 'charset' parameter - not supported by the JS file

Version 1.0.3 (2007-07-14)
    Tested with TinyMCE version 2.1.1

    The get_params() sub now accepts capital letters, not just lower case.
    This was to allow filenames with capital letters, eg 'ru_KOI8-R.js'

    Added the optional 'charset' parameter to tinyMCE_GZ.init, so that
    the correct character set encoding can be specified for language packs
    such as 'ru_KOI8-R.js'.

    Thanks to Yury Don for both of these.

    IE7 now tries the native XMLHttpRequest first.

Version 1.0.2 (2007-04-25)
    The 'compress' option now defaults to true, as per the original
    PHP compressor. (Reported by Nicholas Oxh√∏j)

Version 1.0.1 (2007-04-19)
    Tested with TinyMCE version 2.1.0

    Fixed two bugs in the TinyMCE Perl compressor:
     - the query string was not being properly decoded, and so comma separated
       lists were not being recognised
     - some plugins do not need language packs (eg inlinepopup)

Version 1.0 (2007-03-14)
    First release of the Perl version of the TinyMCE compressor by Clinton Gormley.
    This release is based on the code from the PHP version of the compressor.
